## About me:
I started learning programming from scratch in the middle of 2021, after studying HTML, CSS, I learned JavaScript using various services and reference books, I took a course at [code-basics.com](https://code-basics.com/ru).

After I started to get simple one-page sites, I got acquainted with the React, React Hooks, Material-UI framework. While writing simple applications, I learned and applied in practice working with API, worked with Figma layouts. 

While taking a course at [rs school](https://rs.school/) , I learned how to use the GitHub service.

## Work experience:
*I have no real development experience, but I have a couple of pet projects, one of which I made from the task of the last stage in rs-school*

Here are some of my pet-projects:

1 Calm
[HTML, CSS, Javascript]
An application that shows the user the weather in his city,
has an audio player with a couple of tracks with relaxing music,
there is a todo-list.
The user can enter his name and city which is stored in Local-Storage.
There are also settings that will allow you to remove one or another application option from the screen
or return it.
I also adapted the applications for the smartphone.

[React, SCSS, Axios, MockApi, Bootstrap]
Layout of an online store of computer equipment. It has several pages with product categories, the ability to add and remove
goods to the cart or list of liked products that are stored in MockApi.
The application has a search for a product by its name. Using the Bootstrap framework added a slider with "ads".
